# postgresql://scott:tiger@localhost/mydatabase
# oracle://scott:tiger@127.0.0.1:1521/sidname

# SQLALCHEMY_BINDS
# A dictionary that maps bind keys to SQLAlchemy connection URIs.
# For more information about binds see Multiple Databases with Binds.

# SQLALCHEMY_ECHO
# If set to True SQLAlchemy will log all the statements issued to stderr which can be useful for debugging.

# SQLALCHEMY_RECORD_QUERIES
# Can be used to explicitly disable or enable query recording.
# Query recording automatically happens in debug or testing mode. See get_debug_queries() for more information.

# SQLALCHEMY_NATIVE_UNICODE
# Can be used to explicitly disable native unicode support.
# This is required for some database adapters (like PostgreSQL on some Ubuntu versions) when used with
# improper database defaults that specify encoding-less databases.
###### Deprecated as of v2.4 and will be removed in v3.0.

# SQLALCHEMY_POOL_SIZE
# The size of the database pool. Defaults to the engineâ€™s default (usually 5).
###### Deprecated as of v2.4 and will be removed in v3.0.

# SQLALCHEMY_POOL_TIMEOUT
# Specifies the connection timeout in seconds for the pool.
###### Deprecated as of v2.4 and will be removed in v3.0.

# SQLALCHEMY_POOL_RECYCLE
# Number of seconds after which a connection is automatically recycled.
# This is required for MySQL, which removes connections after 8 hours idle by default.
# Note that Flask-SQLAlchemy automatically sets this to 2 hours if MySQL is used.
# Some backends may use a different default timeout value. For more information about timeouts see Timeouts.
###### Deprecated as of v2.4 and will be removed in v3.0.

# SQLALCHEMY_MAX_OVERFLOW
# Controls the number of connections that can be created after the pool reached its maximum size.
# When those additional connections are returned to the pool, they are disconnected and discarded.
###### Deprecated as of v2.4 and will be removed in v3.0.

SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS = False
# If set to True, Flask-SQLAlchemy will track modifications of objects and emit signals.
# The default is None, which enables tracking but issues a warning that it will be disabled by default in the future.
# This requires extra memory and should be disabled if not needed.

# SQLALCHEMY_ENGINE_OPTIONS
# A dictionary of keyword args to send to create_engine(). See also engine_options to SQLAlchemy.
